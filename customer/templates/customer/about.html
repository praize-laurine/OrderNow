            <p>The Goshen Restaurant situated in an old house in Karen was originally <br>occupied by the famous wildlife photographer and author Alan Root in<br>his youth. Talisman was created by Ian and Charlie Cameron as a small <br>family and friendly kitchen restaurant.</p>
            <p>Stuart Herd and Satyan Patel took over The Talisman in 2012 with a<br> promise to maintain it’s values. The Talisman has since grown into <br> arguably the best restaurant in the country with Chef Ray Cournede <br>leading the team.</p>
            <p>Value for the environment is part of the most important cultures at <br> Talisman. Evident from the ambience and the look of the restaurant <br>itself.</p>
            <p>We are 100% plastic free zone, maintaining an organic garden that <br> supplies some of our fresh produce. All our vendors are vetted and we<br> conduct hygiene tests on supplier products. We use Bamboo straws and <br>all our water bottles are recyclable. Our partners – Takataka solutions <br> ensure that our waste management is done in the highest of standards.</p>
